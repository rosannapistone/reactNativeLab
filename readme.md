# Proof of Concept

## React Native Expo

### How to run the program

After you cloned the project from GitHub run the following commands in the terminal of VS Code:

- npm install
- expo start

Download the app Expo from AppStore or Google Play.

Both devices needs to be connected to the same network.

Use the camera function on your phone for scanning the QR code that will appear in the terminal after the commands above have been ran.

You will also find the locolhost server in the terminal and use that to check out the application in a browser.
